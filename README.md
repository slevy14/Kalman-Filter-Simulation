# Kalman Filter Simulation
**Run main.py to use the simulation.**

# File Breakdown
*main.py*: Creates a Kalman Filter object based on 2D movement and displayes the graph from *analysis_2D*.
*kalman_object.py*: Class containing the Kalman Filter itself.
*analysis_2D.py*: Functions that run the actual simulation by graphing the Kalman Filter data.

## Old Files
*kalman.py*: 1D simulation used for testing. 
*covariance_test.py*: Simple covariance ellipse generation used for testing.
